            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>For this project I wanted to make an app that I would use myself, so I decided to make a budget tracker. This app allows a user to enter a budget that they want and breaks
                it down by how much they can spend a month, week, and day. The app will also keep track of the user current budget, how much they have spent already, and how much they have
                left to spend. This app also allows the user to add individual expenses that they have and that will update how much money they have left to use in their budget. On the admin
                page users can delete any expenses, or all of them. The purpose of this app is to help users manage and budget their money and view their spending habits. Also to help user save 
                their money and manage it.
            </p>

            <h2>API</h2>
            <p>One API returns just the budget that the user has entered. This budget can be changed with a button on the edit page as well. On the main app page the API will return the budget
                to the user and calculated how much they spent and how much they have left to spend as well as monthly, weekly, and daily budgets. There is also and API that handles the expenses. 
                This API on the main app page will display all the expenses that the user currently has, on the edit page the user will be able to add data to this API, and on the admin page the 
                API will display info about the expense as well as be able to delete data from this API.
            </p>
            <hr>
 
            <h2>What went right and what went wrong?</h2>
            <p>I was able to get the project to work the way I wanted which involved having some enter the app, send data to an API, and be able to see that data and change it but deleting it.
                I was also able to get the app to look the way I want, not fancy and over the top, just something simple that is easy to use and quick. I was also able to meet all the requirements 
                for this project. Now for what went wrong, mainly the admin page. I wanted to add an edit button to each expense but that was a bit more complicated then the delete button and I've run
                out of time so I wasn't able to add it. I also wanted to add individual profiles but I didn't want one person, a.k.a the admin, to have access to those user info since budgets should stay
                private. I wanted to try adding user to it but that was a bit more complicated and once again I ran out of time, but seeing as project 2 is required to have profiles I would like to 
                continue with this app and work on making profiles. 
            </p>
            <hr>
 
            <h2>If I continue...</h2>
            <p>If I were to continue with this app I would like to add the option to edit expenses so that users wouldn't have to delete an expense and add it again for a proper change to appear.
                I would also like to clean up some of the code to make it cleaner and easier to understand for people who did right it. I would also like that add profiles so that multiple 
                people can use the app at the same time rather than everyone sharing the app at the same time. I would also like to add more options so that people can track spending habits
                and categories to get how people spend their money and on what. 
            </p>
            <h2>Above and Beyond</h2>
            <p>I believe I went above and beyond in the design of the app. I think a lot of useful information is given back to the user that can help them save and observe their spending habits.
                I also believe I did really well in the CSS, I did it all myself without the help of a framework and it looks good, is simple, and easy to follow and navigate. There was also some
                neat little features I was able to add with the CSS like scale animation when you hover over an expense.
